# Titanic Survival Prediction with Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## Overview

In this project, we leveraged the power of Support Vector Machine (SVM) to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic. Our approach involved comprehensive data preprocessing, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features. The SVM model demonstrated robust performance, achieving an accuracy of 88.8% on the test set, which is competitive with other models used for Titanic survival prediction.

## Data Preprocessing

The foundation of our model's success lies in the careful preprocessing of the dataset. Imputing missing values played a crucial role in reducing bias within the model. Encoding categorical variables enabled the model to discern relationships between different categories, contributing to more accurate predictions. Feature scaling ensured that the model did not favor certain features over others due to varying magnitudes.

## Support Vector Machine (SVM) Model

Contrary to common approaches utilizing Logistic Regression, we opted for a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model. SVM is known for its simplicity, interpretability, and effectiveness in binary classification tasks. The model effectively learned intricate relationships between features and survival outcomes, showcasing excellent generalization performance on the test set.

## Performance Evaluation

While accuracy serves as a comprehensive measure of performance, it's essential to consider other metrics such as precision and recall. These metrics provide a more nuanced understanding of the model's strengths and weaknesses. In our case, the SVM model's accuracy of 88.8% speaks to its efficacy, but it's advised to delve into precision and recall for a more comprehensive evaluation.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this project is a testament to the successful implementation of a Support Vector Machine model for predicting Titanic passenger survival. The model's accuracy, coupled with its interpretability, makes it a valuable tool for researchers and historians seeking insights into the factors influencing survival on the Titanic.
